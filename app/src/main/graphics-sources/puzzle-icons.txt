* Make emulator AVDs with names matching the ones at the bottom of fastlane/Fastfile
  (You could remove the lines for 7 and 10 inch devices there if you only want icons.)
* Go to the project root and run:
  - fastlane build_for_screenshots
  - fastlane screenshots
* Go to app/src/main/jni/icons and run android_icons.sh
* Try the app on a couple of different DPIs
* Commit the new icons so most developers don't have to generate them
